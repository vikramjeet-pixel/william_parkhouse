# Recapa
## Enjoy the show today. Relive it tomorrow.
Recapa is a platform that transforms the concert experience by helping concert-goers stay present during shows while providing high-quality multi-angle recaps synced to the artist's soundboard.

## Overview
Recapa solves a common problem at concerts: the dilemma between capturing memories and being fully present. Our solution allows fans to enjoy distraction-free shows while still receiving premium quality footage afterward.

## How It Works
### For Concert-Goers
1. **Before the Show**: Choose to film as a volunteer or pledge to stay phone-free in the app.
2. **During the Show**: Volunteers capture highlights as they normally would, while others stay present in the moment.
3. **After the Show**: Receive a multi-angle recap synced to the artist's soundboard.

### For Artists & Labels
- **Real-Time Connection**: Phones down means crowd energy spikes.
- **Crowd-Sourced Highlights**: Best fan-shot angles synced to your front-of-house mix.
- **Licensing on Tap**: Pre-cleared rights for promos, music videos, and social media.
- **Fan Rewards**: Boost loyalty with merch drops or backstage passes.
